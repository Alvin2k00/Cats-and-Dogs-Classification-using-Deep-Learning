1. Dataset Extraction

  The dataset can be directly extracted as defined in the code itself.

2. Testing Augmentation Techniques

   Various augmentation techniques were tested to determine their effectiveness. The goal was to see if augmentation improved classification accuracy.

3. Impact of Augmentation

   Proper application of augmentation methods can significantly enhance model performance.

4. Implementation Using TensorFlow

   Augmentation techniques were applied using TensorFlow functions. The operations were performed on symbolic tensors.

5. Key Augmentation Methods Used

   Normalizing – Adjusts pixel values for better model training.

   Horizontal Flipping – Flips images horizontally to increase diversity.

   Rotation – Rotates images to improve generalization.

6. Benefits of Augmentation

   Increases dataset diversity.

It was certainly noticed that the data augmentation certainly increases the performance of the model.
